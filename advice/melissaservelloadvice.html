    <h2>Do You Feel Confused?</h2>

    <div class="first-paragraph">
    <p>When you're going through the process of learning, confusion is a natural occurrence. Remember, you are not the only one who is confused and as you work through the process you become more and more familiar. The key to learning is asking questions and definitely use the SkillCrush Q&A sessions they offer on zoom. Sometimes a personal conversation is all you need to put it together. Don't worry about sounding stupid. You may be helping someone else understand that is afraid to ask.</p>

    <h2>Curiosity Will Help You Move Forward</h2>
